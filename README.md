# Postcoordination Demonstrator

This is an educational project, a front-end application that connects with a Snowstorm terminology server that supports postcoordination 
operations.

## Background

This demonstration complements [SNOMED International's Practical Guide to Postcoordination](http://snomed.org/postcoordination)

## Features

The application provides a postcoordination playground for Transformation Levels 0 and 1, from Close to User Form to Classfiable Form, and examples of postcoordination use cases in clinical forms.

The tools supports sending postcoordinated expressions to be stored in the test terminology server, and the retrieval of the expression as part of the ECL query results (Valueset expansions).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
